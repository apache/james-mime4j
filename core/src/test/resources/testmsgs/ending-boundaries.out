From the RFC about ending boundary:

===================================================================
NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS:  Boundary string comparisons must compare the
boundary value with the beginning of each candidate line.  An exact
match of the entire candidate line is not required; it is sufficient
that the boundary appear in its entirety following the CRLF.

--boundary--

The above boundary should be part of the epilogue, too.
