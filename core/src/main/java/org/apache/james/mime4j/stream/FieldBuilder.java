/**
 * <p>
 * Field builders are intended to construct {@link RawField} instances from multiple lines
 * contained in {@link ByteArrayBuffer}s.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Field builders are stateful and modal as they have to store intermediate results between
 * method invocations and also rely on a particular sequence of method invocations
 * (the mode of operation).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Consumers are expected to interact with field builder in the following way:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Invoke {@link #reset()} method in order to reset builder's internal state and make it
 *   ready to start the process of building a new {@link RawField}.</li>
 * <li>Invoke {@link #append(ByteArrayBuffer)} method one or multiple times in order to build
 *   an internal representation of a MIME field from individual lines of text.</li>
 * <li>Optionally {@link #getRaw()} method can be invoked in order to get combined content
 *   of all lines processed so far. Please note builder implementations can return
 *   <code>null</code> if they do not retain original raw content.</li>
 * <li>Invoke {@link #build()} method in order to generate a {@link RawField} instance
 *   based on the internal state of the builder.</li>
 * </ul>
